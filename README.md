## Purpose:
* To Provide a thin set of compact, container-based pen testing tools written in golang,
  compressed and capable of interoperability either on a single machine or distributed
  across many machines.  These tools should have a CI/CD build pipeline, unit and integration
  tests and be deployable either as Linux, MacOS or Windows binaries or within tool-specific
  containers.
