## Purpose
* To provide a reusable commandline facility for the Asymmetric-Toolkit which is 
  more robust and easily implemented across the mono repo than flags, including
  typed flags, validation functions, and an easy to read Specification structure.
  
* Provide standardized arguments for all asymmetric-toolkit utilities, while 
  not preventing the use of this code in third-party programs.


## Usage
TBD
